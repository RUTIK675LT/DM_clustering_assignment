# Data Mining - Clustering Assignment -

 
### This repository contains colab notebooks in which clustering is the main topic, and is performed on various types of datasets. The colab notrebooks are in the order as follows - 
a) K-Means clustering from scratch
b) Hierarchical clustering (not from scratch)
c) Gaussian mixture models clustering (not from scratch)
d) DB Scan clustering (not from scratch) using pycaret library 
e) Demonstrate anomaly detection using pyOD using any usecase
f) Illustrate clustering of timeseries data using pretrained models 
g) Write a colab to illustrate clustering  of documents. use state of art embeddings (LLM Embeddings).
h) Write a colab for clustering with images using imagebind llm embeddings 
i) Write a colab for audio embeddings using imagebind llms

## Running the notebooks -
1. Open any of the above folders.
2. In each folder there is a file with `.ipynb` extension, this is python notebook, and also the dataset on which clustering is performed.
3. You can preview the operations which I performed by opening the python notebook in preview mode, or you can select `Open in Colab` button and it will open my python notebook in google colab.
4. Alternatively, if you wish to execute the code in your own environment, first you need to load the provided dataset and modify the path of the dataset inorder to perform operations on it.
